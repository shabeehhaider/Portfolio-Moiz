      The Art of Cinematic Storytelling
    </h1>
    <p>
      With a decade of experience in filmmaking and commercial directing, I bring a wealth of expertise in creating captivating 
      narratives. Holding a master's degree in filmmaking from Punjab 
      University, Lahore, my journey is driven by passion and dedication.
      I specialize in the automobile industry, having directed and 
      conceptualized campaigns for brands like Hyundai, Toyota, Peugeot, 
      Kia, MG, and Suzuki. Beyond this, I have collaborated with industry 
      giants such as Coca-Cola, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble, along 
      with many other international brands, weaving stories that reflect the 
      human experience.
      My commitment to authenticity and innovation ensures each project 
      is a true reflection of my vision. From concept to screen, my work 
      speaks volumes, leaving a lasting impact on those who experience it.
